This repository aims to establish a peer-to-peer connection using the WebRTC framework, enabling real-time file synchronization between peers. Both peers can collaboratively edit a file and see updates reflected instantly on both ends, facilitating shared code editing at the file level.

In essence, it's a makeshift code-sharing platform, built in Go.
